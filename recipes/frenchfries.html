    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>There's nothing quite like the enticingly crisp skin and fluffy interior of a french fry.</p>
    <p>Chef John's easy-to-follow recipe features a double-fried method that gets delicious, restaurant-style results every time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying, about 2 cups or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</li>

        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F
             (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry
              for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally.</li>

              <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</li>

              <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second 
                time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>

                <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
    </ol>
